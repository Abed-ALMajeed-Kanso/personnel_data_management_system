Personnel Data Management System is a Flask-based API project designed to manage and interact with a dataset of people. 
It provides various endpoints to retrieve, add, search, and delete individual records. The API allows users to search for 
people by name, retrieve data by unique identifiers (UUID), and count the total number of records. It also includes functionality 
to add new records and delete existing ones by their UUID. The project was a part of a course I completed on Coursera
